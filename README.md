# Page transitions with Bender

Bender is a package that empowers your application with page transitions. There is an example app and you can click [here](http://benderdemo.meteor.com/) to see it in action.

# Dependencies

* Meteor 1.0

# Getting Started

To install Bender add it to meteor

```
meteor add gabrielpoca:bender
```

To use Bender you need to initialize it with the page container as an argument.

```coffee
Template.layout.rendered = ->
  Bender.initialize(@find('#content-container'))
```

## Animating elements

By default Bender will have no animation after being initialized. You can change
this by calling the `animate` function.

```coffee
Bender.animate('slideRight')
```

It is also possible to use with
[`Iron.Router`](http://eventedmind.github.io/iron-router/), but instead of
`Router.go` use `Bender.go` and pass in the animation as an option. Everything
else should work as expected with the `Iron.Router`.

```coffee
IronBender.go('trips.show', { _id: @id }, { animation: 'slideDown' })
```

### List of available animations
